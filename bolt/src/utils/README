# Utility Functions for src/

Here we define any useful utilitity functions that may be needed by a user while computing moments.

Implemented utility functions:

- integral_over_v : In the code the default structure for the distribution function has the variation in v along axis 0. We have defined a function that performs this summation along axis 0 to get the integral over v-space.
