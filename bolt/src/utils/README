Here we define any useful utilitity functions that may be needed by a user while computing moments.

Implemented utility functions:

- integral_over_p : In the code the default structure for the distribution function has the variation in p along axis 0. We have defined a function that performs this summation along axis 0 to get the integral over p-space.
