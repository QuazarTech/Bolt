This folder contains tests with the density setup as a small sinusoidal perturbation about a mean value:

n = 1 + epsilon_1 * sin(2 * pi * x + 4 * pi * y)
      + epsilon_2 * cos(2 * pi * x + 4 * pi * y)

We observe the evolution of the various quantities as given by the nonlinear and linear solver, and check that the results yielded match each other.

We broadly consider 4 different cases for this setup:

- Purely collisionless, No EM fields
- Collisional, No EM fields
- Purely collisionless, Electrostatic Case(Landau Damping)
- Collisional, Electrostatic Case

We solve for all possible combinations of dimesionality in position and velocity space:

- 1D1V - 1D perturbation with a 1V distribution function
- 1D2V - 1D perturbation with a 2V distribution function
- 1D3V - 1D perturbation with a 3V distribution function

- 2D1V - 2D perturbation with a 1V distribution function
- 2D2V - 2D perturbation with a 2V distribution function
- 2D3V - 2D perturbation with a 3V distribution function
