This is the folder that contains the runs we are using to study the thermal transport in plasmas across different regimes of collisionality. As a preliminary starting point we setup our initial conditions following the closely related work of S.Komarov(https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11462) and Roberg-Clark(https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00057).
