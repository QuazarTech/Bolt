This folder contains tests where a gaussian perturbation is advected through p-space:

In this folder we consider a thorough convergence check which needs to be passing at O(N^{-2}) to validate the correctness of our implementation for operations in p-space. Similar to the advected gaussian pulse in q-space, each individual folder contains a main.py which outputs dump files upon which a post processing script is used to get images which are a visual check of how the blob advects in p-space. The convergence tests can be run by executing convergence_test.py

We consider 3 different convergence tests for this:

- Advection with constant (E1, E2), zero (B1, B2, B3) till a time t before blob hits boundaries in p space
  Reference Solution: f(p1 - (e/m)*E1*t, p2 - (e/m)*E2*t)

- Rotation with zero (E1, E2), (B1=0, B2=0, B3!=0)
  Reference Solution: Initial Solution.

- Advection with constant (E1, E2), (B1=0, B2=0, B3!=0) 
  Reference Solution: f(p1 - A_p1*t, p2 - A_p2*t)
