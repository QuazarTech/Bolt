This folder contains tests where a gaussian pulse is advected through p-space:

In this folder we consider a thorough convergence check which needs to be passing at O(N^{-2}) to validate the correctness of our implementation for operations in p-space. Similar to the advected gaussian pulse in q-space, each individual folder contains a main.py which outputs dump files upon which a post processing script is used to get images which are a visual check of how the blob advects in p-space. The convergence tests can be run by executing convergence_test.py

In 3V, we consider the following convergence checks:

- Advection with constant (E1, E2, E3, B1, B2, B3) != 0

    - Reference Solution: Initial State
      We trace the trajectory of the center of the blob using odeint to get the time when the blob returns
      to the center(numerically:distance from origin is minimum), and improve the accuracy of the solution 
      using scipy.optimize.root. We evolve to this final time on the nonlinear solver. 
    
    - Reference Solution: f(p1 - p1_center_final, p2 - p2_center_final, p3 - p3_center_final)
      We trace the trajectory of the center of the blob using odeint to get the final resting spot of the
      center of the blob (p1_center_final, p2_center_final, p3_center_final). Then using this, we get the reference distribution function f(p1 - p1_center_final, p2 - p2_center_final, p3 - p3_center_final) to check against 
      what we get numerically using the nonlinear solver.
