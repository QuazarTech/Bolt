This folder contains tests where a gaussian pulse is advected through p-space:

In this folder we consider a set of thorough convergence checks which need to be passing at O(N^{-2}) to validate the correctness of our implementation for operations in p-space. The convergence tests can be run by executing convergence_test.py

In 3V, we consider the following convergence checks:

- Advection with constant (E1, E2, E3, B1, B2, B3) != 0
    Reference Solution: f(p1 - p1_center_final, p2 - p2_center_final, p3 - p3_center_final)
      We trace the trajectory of the center of the blob using odeint to get the final resting spot of the
      center of the blob (p1_center_final, p2_center_final, p3_center_final). Then using this, we get the reference distribution function f(p1 - p1_center_final, p2 - p2_center_final, p3 - p3_center_final) to check against 
      what we get numerically using the nonlinear solver.

- Rotation with constant (B1, B2, B3) != 0;(E1, E2, E3) = 0
    Reference Solution: Initial distribution.
