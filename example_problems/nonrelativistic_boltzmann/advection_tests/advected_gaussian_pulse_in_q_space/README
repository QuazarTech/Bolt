This folder contains tests where a gaussian perturbation is advected through q-space:

While one of the scripts in each of the folders shows outputs the images every timestep to show how the pulse advects for one time period for a visual check, we consider a more thorough convergence check which needs to be passing at O(N^{-2}) to validate the correctness of our implementation.

We consider 2 different convergence tests for this:

- Advection for a single time period back to the initial state
  Reference Solution: Initial Solution

- Advection till a time t before the blob hits the boundaries
  Reference Solution: f(q1 - p1*t, q2 - p2*t)

We run the above test cases checking using periodic as well as mirror boundary conditions.
