This folder contains tests with the density, temperature and bulk velocity quantities setup as a small gaussian perturbation about a mean value:

    rho = rho_b + 0.01 * exp(-(x - 0.5)**2 -
                              (y - 0.5)**2)

    T   = T_b + 0.01 * exp(-(x - 0.5)**2 -
                            (y - 0.5)**2)

    p1_bulk = 0.01 * exp(-(x - 0.5)**2 -(y - 0.5)**2)
    p2_bulk = 0.01 * exp(-(x - 0.5)**2 -(y - 0.5)**2)
    p3_bulk = 0.01 * exp(-(x - 0.5)**2 -(y - 0.5)**2)


We observe the evolution of the various quantities as given by the nonlinear and linear solver, and check that the results yielded match each other.

We broadly consider 4 different cases for this setup:

- Purely collisionless, No EM fields
- Collisional, No EM fields
- Purely collisionless, Electrostatic Case
- Collisional, Electrostatic Case
