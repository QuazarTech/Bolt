This folder contains tests with the density setup as a small sinusoidal perturbation about a mean value:

n = 1 + epsilon_1 * sin(2 * pi * x + 4 * pi * y)
      + epsilon_2 * cos(2 * pi * x + 4 * pi * y)

We observe the evolution of the various quantities as given by the nonlinear and linear solver, and check that the results yielded match each other.

We broadly consider 4 different cases for this setup:

- Purely collisionless, No EM fields
- Collisional, No EM fields
- Purely collisionless, Electrostatic Case(Landau Damping)
- Collisional, Electrostatic Case
